		<section class="five" id="page-more">
			<p class="para5">On Martin Luther King Day, John Carrillo, a longtime fixture on the OC singer-songwriter circuit, asked a friend if he wanted to go to the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles.  Carrillo, a huge fan of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, the Who,  and a myriad of other artists, had never been. But his friend was busy, so Carrillo would have to wait another day.

			That day never came.

			Five days later, the 48-year-old suffered a massive heart attack and, after languishing in a coma for two weeks, passed away Feb. 9.

			It was a startlingly abrupt end to the life of someone who was a constant presence at open mics and anywhere musicians gathered in Orange County the past 25 years.   Carrillo, who recorded with such luminaries as legendary bass player Carol Kaye and appeared at bars and clubs and hosted open mics from the Gypsy Den and Alta Coffee to the Pint House and (the now defunct) Pepperland Music,  leaves behind three recorded albums, a wife (BJ Carrillo,) and a flood of memories for those who knew him well, and for those who just made his acquaintance.
