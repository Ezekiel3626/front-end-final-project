			<h2>First</h2>
			<p>Joan was quizzical, studied pataphysical
			Science in the home
			Late nights all alone with a test-tube ohh oh oh oh
			Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine
			Calls her on the phone
			Can I take you out to the pictures, Joan?
			But as she's getting ready to go
			A knock comes on the door</p>
		</section>

		<section id="page-second">
			<h2>Second</h2>
			<p>Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
			Teacher gets annoyed
			Wishing to avoid an unpleasant scene
			She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
			So he waits behind
			Writing 50 times "I must not be so" oh oh oh
			But when she turns her back on the boy
			He creeps up from behind</p>
		</section>

		<section id="page-chorus">
			<h2>Chorus</h2>
			<p>Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
			Came down upon her head
			Do do do do do
			Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer
			Made sure that she was dead</p>
		</section>

		<section id="page-third">
			<h2>Third</h2>
			<p>P.C. Thirty-One said "We caught a dirty one"
			Maxwell stands alone
			Painting testimonial pictures ohh oh oh oh
			Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery
			Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free)
			The judge does not agree and he tells them so oh oh oh
			But as the words are leaving his lips
			A noise comes from behind</p>
		</section>

			<p>On Martin Luther King Day, John Carrillo, a longtime fixture on the OC singer-songwriter circuit, asked a friend if he wanted to go to the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles.  Carrillo, a huge fan of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, the Who,  and a myriad of other artists, had never been. But his friend was busy, so Carrillo would have to wait another day.

			That day never came.

			Five days later, the 48-year-old suffered a massive heart attack and, after languishing in a coma for two weeks, passed away Feb. 9.

			It was a startlingly abrupt end to the life of someone who was a constant presence at open mics and anywhere musicians gathered in Orange County the past 25 years.   Carrillo, who recorded with such luminaries as legendary bass player Carol Kaye and appeared at bars and clubs and hosted open mics from the Gypsy Den and Alta Coffee to the Pint House and (the now defunct) Pepperland Music,  leaves behind three recorded albums, a wife (BJ Carrillo,) and a flood of memories for those who knew him well, and for those who just made his acquaintance.
